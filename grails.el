;;; Commentary:

;; Description:

;; Grails.el is a minor mode that allows an easy
;; navigation of Gails projects.  It allows jump to a model, to a view,
;; to a controller or to a service.
;;
;; For more details, see the project page at
;; https://github.com/lifeisfoo/emacs-grails
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Copy this file to to some location in your Emacs load path.  Then add
;; "(require 'grails)" to your Emacs initialization (.emacs,
;; init.el, or something).
;;
;; Example config:
;;
;;   (require 'grails)

;; Then, to auto enable grails mode, create a .dir-locals.el file
;; in the root of the grails project with this configuration:

;; ((groovy-mode (grails . 1))
;;  (html-mode (grails . 1))
;;  (java-mode (grails . 1)))

;; In this way, the grails mode will be auto enabled when any of
;; these major modes are loaded (only in this directory tree - the project tree)
;; (you can attach it to other modes if you want).

;; The first time that this code is executed, Emacs will show a security
;; prompt: answer "!" to mark code secure and save your decision.
;; (a configuration line is automatically added to your .emacs file)

;; In order to have grails minor mode always enabled inside your project tree,
;; place inside your `.dir-locals.el`:

;;   ((nil . ((grails . 1))))
;;
